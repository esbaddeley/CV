## Who am I?

Dedicated and driven, I'm passionate about exploring new ideas, developing well crafted code, and using technology to build products that make a difference.

I was drawn to coding after working at The Open University and seeing the how education technology was opening up access to higher education. I enrolled at Makers Academy to learn the fundamentals of software craftsmanship, and develop the skills to write quality code and build well-designed applications.

I'm looking for a role that will challenge me to solve new problems,and to always to keep learning and developing as a programmer.


## Skills

####  Proactive Problem Solving

- In code - I spent a lot of Makers Academy learning better ways to solve programming problems and debug errors by breaking down a problem to identify the key issue, then hypothesising about the root cause of this and methodically investigating to eliminate options and solve the problem.

- In work - I've worked in a number of roles which required me to complete complex tasks under tight time constraints. i applied problem solving techniques to find efficient and effective solutions to these problems, and identify which issues would need to be escalated. By solving problems I was able to build strong relationships with my colleagues, and a reputation for taking ownership of issues.

- Making mistakes - I've learnt more from doing things wrong than doing things well. Whenever I make a mistake I focus on what I can learn from the situation, and what I would do differently in the future.


#### Confident Communicator

I've learnt to adapt and tailor my communication style to suit different situations and audiences. In particular, i've developed my communication skills by;

- Working as part of a team - At Makers Academy we pair programmed every day to write code, and I learnt that coding effectively meant communicating clearly and often, and listening to understand how different people preferred to work. We also built projects as part of a team which required similar techniques, but also the ability to recognise conflict and de-escalate situations through empathetic communications.

- Building strong relationships in professional roles - Most of my previous roles have required my to develop positive relationships with colleagues, clients and senior executives. By adapting my communication style to suit the situation i've built strong relationships that have helped me get work done more efficiently.

- Writing - A key part of my last role involved research and drafting short briefings for my manager and other senior executives. I developed my ability to convey the key points of an issue in clear and concise writing.

- Clean Code - I'm continuing to develop an appreciation of how clean code more effectively conveys meaning and intention, and i'm working on my refactoring and design skills to improve the readability of my code.


#### Lifelong Learner

- I'm curious and inquisitive and I've always wanted to understand how things work. I've learnt new skills and knowledge in every professional role i've had. I've appreciated the opportunities to understand different points of view, particularly where they challenge my own and make me think harder about the assumptions I make.

- I'm passionate about education and believe everyone should have the opportunity to access education. I've been proud to work for the Open University and support the work they do on opening up access to higher education. I'm currently volunteering as a coach at Codebar to help support people who are learning to code and become more involved in the coding community
